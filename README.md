  <p>I'm a non-binary developer from the United Kingdom, best known for my plugins HeadsPlus and AdvancedTeleport in Minecraft. I was also the developer of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwHFnZdACHQ">CaptainSparklez' Extreme Snowball Fight between Nitrado and MCProHosting</a>, previously being the Events Developer at Nitrado and a Customer Support Representative for MCProHosting. However, I also have a series of smaller projects that are Qol-oriented and simplistic.</p>
  <p>Whilst I work with high-level tools and frameworks by day, I enjoy poking between the wires and delving into lower levels, with my degree dissertation focusing heavily on decompiling Java programs, requiring me to fully understand Java bytecode. I've also picked up Unity game modding (such as R.E.P.O.) and have taken what I have learned from Minecraft modding to apply it back to .NET.</p>
  <p>Outside of development, I am the President of the Computer Science Society (CSS) at UoB, a digital artist and storywriter (with a Dungeons and Dragons campaign surrounding a Minecraft minigame), a Computer Science student and an avid cat enjoyer.</p>

  <h2>Private Work/Commissions</h2>
  I've been asked a few times about adding specific features to plugins, being a developer for a server or making a custom plugin altogether for payment - whilst I do appreciate the sentiment, I do not take commissions, as my general schedule is too packed to take on extra work. Generally, if I do find the time to add a feature to any of my existing work, I will add it, but feel free to poke me if I forget after a week or two.
